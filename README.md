# Profile Setup
This is a basic script that *should* allow me to automatically do some of the
basic configuration stuff to set up a comfortable profile/work environment on
a new Debian installation or profile.

It installs FVWM2, Korn Shell (ksh93), and several other programs I regularly
use or otherwise depend on. I do not really think it is anywhere near being
'all-encompassing.'

The idea is that the next time I do a fresh install or transfer a profile to
another machine, there'll be less dumb boilerplate stuff to figure out or
remember to do.
